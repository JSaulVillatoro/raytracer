Ray Tracer Part 2

To run: Make using the "make" command. Then run the program with the following syntax: 

./raytrace [image_width] [image_height] -S [p,g] -I [input_file]

the -S flag indicates the shading model, 'p' for Phong, and 'g' for Gaussian.

All the .pov files on your website under "Project 1 - part 2, shading and shadows" are located in the "povray_files" folder.

Once the program has run, the output file will be created wherever the input file was located.

My renders of the .pov files in "povray_files" are located in the "my_renders" folder. They are all rendered using the Phong shading model.

I believe my ray tracer meets all the requirements for this project assignment. While functional, there are some design choices I am unsatisfied with and i will tweak them in the coming days.
